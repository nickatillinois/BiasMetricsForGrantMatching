applicants to this rfa are only required to submit the first five training data tables requested of applicants to the ruth l. kirschstein nrsa institutional research training ( t32) grant mechanism. if applicable, the qualifications of recent and/or current pre-doctoral applicant trainees may either be presented in tables 8a and/or 9a respectively or discussed in narrative form. 2. funds available nibib has set aside $3- 4m to fund between 10-12 interdisciplinary research training programs under this initiative. applicants may not request more than $500,000 in direct costs or more than 10 slots for any grant year. because the nature and scope of the proposed interdisciplinary research training programs will vary from application to application, it is anticipated that the size of each award will also vary. the number of awards and the actual amount awarded are therefore contingent upon the receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications and will depend upon the number, quality, and costs of the applications received. although the financial plans of the ic(s) provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds and the receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. facilities and administrative costs requested by consortium participants are not included in the direct cost limitation, see not-od-05-004 . nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made in response to this foa. allowable costs: a. stipends: stipends are provided as a subsistence allowance for trainees to help defray living expenses during the research training experience and are based on a 12-month appointment period. this stipend is not provided as a condition of employment with either the federal government or the grantee institution nor is it to be considered a payment for services performed. stipends will be based on the annual pre-doctoral nrsa stipend level at the time of award. the annual stipend level for a pre-doctoral trainee for fiscal year (fy) 2008 is $20,772. stipends may be adjusted only at the time of appointment or reappointment and may not be changed in the middle of an appointment period. for appointments of less than a full year, the stipend will be based on a monthly or daily pro-ration of the annual amount. no departure from the established stipend schedule may be negotiated by the institution with the trainee (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-07-057.html for specific information). b. tuition and fees: the nih will offset the combined costs of tuition and fees at the rate in place at the time of the award. the rate currently provides an amount per predoctoral trainee equal to 60% of the level requested by the applicant institution, up to $16,000 per year. costs associated with this category are allowable only if they are required for specific courses as part of the approved research training program and are applied consistently to all persons in a similar research training status at the institution regardless of the source of support. a full description of the nih tuition policy, see: http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-06-093.html . c. trainee travel: trainee travel to attend scientific meetings and workshops that the institution determines to be necessary for the individual’s research training experience is an allowable trainee expense. in addition, the nibib requires that applicants include funds to allow training program director(s) (pds) and two to four trainees to attend the biennial nibib training grantee meeting, held in even-numbered years in the washington dc/bethesda, md area. note that funds for pds should be included under training related expenses (tre) while funds for trainees to attend the meeting should be requested as trainee travel. funds may not be expended to cover the costs of travel between the trainee s place of residence and the training institution, except that the grantee organization may authorize a one-way travel allowance in an individual case of extreme hardship. additionally, support for travel to a research training experience away from the institution may be permitted. research training experiences away from the parent organization must be justified considering the type of opportunities available for training, the manner in which these opportunities differ from, and complement those, offered at the parent institution, and the relationship of the proposed training experience to the trainee’s career stage and goals. this type of travel and research training requires prior approval from the nibib. letters requesting such training may be submitted to the nibib at any time during the award period. d. training-related expenses: the applicant institution may request the nih standard nrsa training-related expenses ($4,200 annually for each predoctoral trainee in fy 2008) to help defray other research training expenses, such as health insurance, staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, research supplies, and travel expenses for the training faculty directly related to the research training program (see http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-06-093.html for additional information). funds are provided as a lump sum on the basis of the predetermined amount per predoctoral trainee approved for support. under exceptional circumstances, which can include accommodating the disabilities of a trainee, it is possible to request training-related expenses above the standard level. requests for additional costs must be explained in detail and justified in the application. consultation with nibib staff in advance of such requests is strongly advised. e. facilities and administrative allowance: a facilities and administrative allowance (indirect cost allowance) based on 8% of total modified direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, health insurance, and equipment) may be requested. f. stipend supplementation, compensation, and other income: stipend supplementation: the grantee institution is allowed to provide funds to an individual in addition to the stipends paid in the form of stipend supplementation or in the form of compensation. under no circumstances may the conditions of stipend supplementation or the services provided for compensation interfere with, detract from, or prolong the trainee's approved nrsa training program. grantees may supplement stipends from non-federal funds provided the supplementation is without obligation to the trainee. an organization can determine what amount of stipend supplementation, if any, will be provided according to its own formally established policies governing stipend support. these policies must be consistently applied to all individuals in a similar training status regardless of the source of funds. federal funds may not be used for stipend supplementation unless specifically authorized under the terms of the program from which funds are derived. an individual may use federal educational loan funds or va benefits when permitted by those programs. under no circumstances may dhhs funds be used for supplementation. compensation: funds characterized as compensation may be paid to trainees only when there is an employer-employee relationship, the payments are for services rendered, and the situation otherwise meets all of the conditions and policies in the nih grants policy statement. additionally, compensation must be in accordance with organizational policies consistently applied to both federally and non-federally supported activities and must be supported by acceptable accounting records that reflect the employer-employee relationship. an institution may provide additional funds to a trainee in the form of compensation (as salary and/or tuition remission) for services performed outside of the responsibilities of the full-time nrsa-supported training such as teaching or serving as a research assistant. a trainee may receive compensation for services as a research assistant or in some other position on a federal research grant, including a dhhs research grant. however, compensated services should occur on a limited, part-time basis apart from the normal full-time research training activities. in addition, compensation may not be paid from a research grant that supports the same research that is part of the trainee’s planned training experience as approved in the institutional training grant application. pds must approve all instances of employment on research grants to verify that the circumstances will not detract from or prolong the approved training program. a full description of the nih policy regarding nrsa supplementation and compensation can be found in the nih grants policy statement at http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/nihgps_part11.htm . educational loans or g.i. bill : an individual may make use of federal educational loan funds and assistance under the veterans readjustment benefits act (g.i. bill). such funds are not considered supplementation or compensation. section

and advance the interdisciplinary reach, innovation, and impact of population research through encouraging the development of new directions and approaches to population research and the aggressive pursuit of scientific opportunities appearing at the boundaries between traditional population research and allied fields. scope the program for population research infrastructure seeks to advance scientific knowledge in areas related to the mission of the demographic and behavioral sciences branch. dbsb is one of three branches of the center for population research of the nichd. dbsb’s mission is to improve the health and well-being of individuals, families, and populations by adding to knowledge about human population dynamics and their causes and consequences. dbsb supports demographic, behavioral and social sciences research on fertility, families, population movement, health and mortality, hiv/aids, and population composition. research on population diversity and change, studies of the consequences of population diversity and change for health and well-being, and research on the interrelationships among individual, family, group, community, and population processes are all central to this mission. to achieve these goals, dbsb fosters innovative and multi-disciplinary research by providing awards to individual investigators and research teams as well as supporting research training and infrastructure in the population sciences. dbsb defines "population" as the aggregate collection of individuals in a defined geographic area and/or social or demographic group. examples include the residents of new york city, married people in the u.s., and african american children under age five. aggregates defined by their participation in a study, program, or service are not considered populations under this definition. further information about dbsb’s mission can be found on dbsb’s website, http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/cpr/dbs/ . illustrative examples of population research topics that fall within the dbsb mission include, but are not limited to, the list that follows: research on the antecedents and consequences of changes in population size, structure, and composition, including the documentation, analysis, and/or projection of population composition with respect to demographic, economic, social, and geographic characteristics; economic and social mobility; the relationship of economic, social, and cultural factors to population change; and the interrelationship between population and the physical environment. demographic, social science, and behavioral science research on families and households, including studies of the determinants of trends in marriage, divorce, and cohabitation; the formation of and changes in household structures, fatherhood, patterns of child support and visitation with absent parents; the use of child care services; the relationship between changing fertility and family patterns and the well-being of children; intergenerational demography; and the implications of welfare and health policies on families. demographic, social science, and behavioral science research on fertility, including studies of individual, social, economic, and cultural determinants and consequences of fertility and fertility trends; the interrelationship between fertility patterns and education, work, union formation and dissolution, family structure, and health; and contraceptive use, abortion, and sexual behavior. research on population movement and distribution, including studies of the determinants and consequences of international and internal migration and residential mobility; assimilation and adaptation of migrants; migrant selectivity; residential segregation; and spatial demography. demographic and social science research on health, morbidity, disability, health disparities, and mortality, including research on infant mortality and low birth weight; and research that relates demographic and social processes to mortality and health across the life course and to the health and well being of children (see http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/cpr/dbs/prog_mort/index.cfm for more information). demographic, social science, and behavioral science research on the sexual transmission of hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases, including studies of sexual behaviors related to hiv and other std transmission; the interrelationships between social, institutional, economic, and cultural contexts and sexual behavior; the interrelationships among pregnancy, pregnancy prevention, and hiv and other std prevention; theoretically grounded intervention studies within these areas; and related methodological studies (see http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/cpr/dbs/prog_hivstd/index.cfm ). for other specific diseases and conditions not mentioned above, research that primarily focuses on the social, cultural, familial, and economic determinants and consequences of these diseases and conditions. centers with strong research programs in areas within the mission of dbsb are encouraged to develop research projects with researchers outside the traditional areas of population research (for instance, anthropology, geography, biological sciences, epidemiology, public health, and medicine) in order to develop innovative interdisciplinary science that addresses important issues in the population research. potential applicants seeking information on establishing a new population research center or in refocusing the research activities of currently ineligible research centers so that they become eligible for prip support may consult with program staff listed under section vii. agency contact(s) . applicants responding to this foa should have in place (or propose in their applications) effective mechanisms for fostering the development of an intellectual community that bridges investigators from different disciplines and different projects and promotes innovation in population research. they must also articulate a clear vision for their research center and its current and future contributions to population research. applicants must identify the signature population-related themes of the center. these themes must be relevant to the dbsb mission. signature themes are defined as research topics that exemplify the applicant center’s most significant current and/or anticipated contributions to population research. the themes should reflect the major strengths of the center, but do not need to encompass all research topics covered by the center’s researchers. applicants must also articulate a vision for the potential future contributions of the center. infrastructure support applicants may request support for three categories: (1) research support cores; (2) developmental infrastructure; and (3) public infrastructure. applicants should request the types and levels of support that best suit their needs and objectives; they are not obligated to request support in all categories. the nichd expects that the types of infrastructure support requested and the amount of funding requested for each type of infrastructure will vary. the first two categories of infrastructure support are intended to advance the scientific program of the applicant research center. for these categories, applicants must justify the types and amounts of support requested in terms of: (1) the scope, objectives, and current and potential impact of the current and planned research at the applicant's population center; (2) the potential contribution of requested infrastructure to advancing the current and planned research at the applicant’s population center; and (3) the cost-effectiveness of the requested support. applicants are expected to provide guidelines for determining the eligibility of researchers and research projects to access resources provided through the prip program, and guidelines and procedures for allocating these resources. no restrictions on access (e.g., by students, investigators lacking research support, investigators in fields other than population research) are imposed under this announcement. however, applicants must demonstrate that their proposed guidelines and procedures for controlling access to resources provided through the prip program are consistent with the goal of effectively advancing the scientific program of the center and the goals of this foa. similarly, the announcement imposes no restrictions on how applicants define membership in their center. applicants are encouraged to develop flexible guidelines for membership that permit the involvement of researchers from all fields relevant for the goals of their research center. membership in the center and access to resources provided through the prip program may be extended to individuals who do not meet the criteria used to define applicant eligibility (see section

http://era.nih.gov/electronicreceipt/preparing.htm for instructions). each pd/pi is expected to devote a minimum of 25% effort to the project. the decision of whether to apply for a grant with a single pd/pi or multiple pds/pis is the responsibility of the investigators and applicant organizations and should be determined by the scientific goals of the project. applications for grants with multiple pds/pis will require additional information, as outlined in the instructions below. the nih review criteria for approach, investigators, and environment have been modified to accommodate applications involving either a single pd/pi or multiple pds/pis. when considering multiple pds/pis, please be aware that the structure and governance of the pd/pi leadership team as well as the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual pds/pis will be factored into the assessment of the overall scientific merit of the application. multiple pds/pis on a project share the authority and responsibility for leading and directing the project, intellectually and logistically. each pd/pi is responsible and accountable to the grantee organization, or, as appropriate, to a collaborating organization, for the proper conduct of the project or program, including the submission of required reports. for further information on multiple pds/pis, please see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/multi_pi . 2. cost sharing or matching this program does not require cost sharing as defined in the current nih grants policy statement . 3. other-special eligibility

restrictions all nih awards are subject to the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the nih grants policy statement. the grants policy statement can be found at nih grants policy statement . pre-award costs are allowable. a grantee may, at its own risk and without nih prior approval, incur obligations and expenditures to cover costs up to 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new award if such costs: 1) are necessary to conduct the project, and 2) would be allowable under the grant, if awarded, without nih prior approval. if specific expenditures would otherwise require prior approval, the grantee must obtain nih approval before incurring the cost. nih prior approval is required for any costs to be incurred more than 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new award. the incurrence of pre-award costs in anticipation of a competing or non-competing award imposes no obligation on nih either to make the award or to increase the amount of the approved budget if an award is made for less than the amount anticipated and is inadequate to cover the pre-award costs incurred. nih expects the grantee to be fully aware that pre-award costs result in borrowing against future support and that such borrowing must not impair the grantee's ability to accomplish the project objectives in the approved time frame or in any way adversely affect the conduct of the project (see nih grants policy statement https://grants.nih.gov/archive/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/index.htm .) 6. other submission

fda will contribute up to $90,000 per year toward the salary of the k99 award recipient. applicants may request higher s alary in cases of individuals with exceptional salary needs. candidates (intramural or extramural) are required to commit a minimum of 75% of full-time professional effort (i.e. minimum of 9 person-months) to the pursuit of their career development and research experience during the mentored phase. this experience may also include activities such as completing research publications and searching for an independent research position. candidates may engage in teaching and/or clinical duties as part of the remaining 25% of the candidate’s full-time professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program. intramural: the requests by nih intramural scientists will not include any salary and related fringe benefits for career, career conditional or other federal employees (civilian or uniformed service) with permanent appointments under existing position ceilings or any costs related to research support or administrative or facilities support (equivalent to facilities and administrative or f&a costs). applicants should indicate the number of person-months devoted to the project. if selected, appropriate funding will be provided by the fda center for tobacco products. the intramural scientist should submit a separate request for intramural funding as described above. budget details for the mentored phase will be negotiated with the sponsoring intramural laboratory institute/center and salary will be consistent with that offered new scientists in similar positions. extramural: mentored candidates in an extramural sponsoring institution/organization will be supported by nih extramural funds. salary must be consistent with the established salary structure at the institution from its own funds to other staff members of equivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the department concerned. fringe benefits should be requested based on the sponsoring institution’s rate. the extramural sponsoring institution may supplement the nih salary contribution up to a level that is consistent with the institution's salary scale. however, supplementation may not be from federal funds unless specifically authorized by the federal program from which such funds are derived. in no case may additional phs funds beyond those provided in the k99 award be used for salary supplementation. under expanded authorities, however, institutions may rebudget funds within the total costs awarded to cover salaries consistent with the institution's salary scale. institutional supplementation of salary must not require extra duties or responsibilities that would interfere with the purpose of this award. the total salary paid from nih funds, however, may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap. see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.htm . for information regarding nih policy on determining full-time professional effort for career awards see not-od-04-056 . the requested salary must be consistent both with the established salary structure at the institution and with salaries actually provided by the institution from its own funds to other staff members with equivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the department concerned. if full-time, 12-month salaries are not currently paid to comparable staff members, the salary proposed must be related appropriately to the existing salary structure. confirmation of salary is required prior to the issuance of an award. fringe benefits based on the sponsoring institution’s rate and the percent of effort are provided in addition to the salary. allowable costs: independent phase (r00) the total cost for the independent investigator phase (r00) may not exceed $249,000 per year. this amount includes salary, fringe benefits, research support allowance and applicable indirect costs. indirect costs will be reimbursed at the extramural sponsoring institution’s indirect cost rate. indirect costs requested by consortium participants are included in the total cost limitation. the salary requested should be based on the person-months effort to be devoted to the r00 project, as is the case for other research grant awards. the candidate is required to devote a total of 75% of their full-time, 12 month professional effort to research (i.e., a full-time 9 person-months). see eligibility below. however, it may not be feasible to support this entire effort through the r00 project alone. recipients of the r00 phase awards may devote effort to other research projects and may reduce effort on the r00 award if they receive additional independent research support. please note that a reduction of time devoted to a project by 25% or more from the level in an approved application will require nih prior approval as described in the nih grants policy statement. other program-related expenses fda will contribute $60,000 per year toward the research development costs of the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities. research expenses may include (a) tuition and fees related to career development; (b) supplies, equipment and technical personnel; c) travel to research meetings or training; and (d) statistical services including personnel and computer time. salary for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed. indirect costs for the extramural k99 phase, indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs. for the r00 phase, indirect costs will be reimbursed at the extramural sponsoring institution’s indirect cost rate. nih

RFA-DA-09-013,ii. animal models: sophisticated animal behavioral models are available to study the initiation of drug abuse behavior, sustained/continued use, escalation to compulsive use, withdrawal from drugs and relapse to drug-seeking. however, we know relatively little about the neurobiological changes that exercise and physical activity initiate at the cellular or circuit-levels that may have functional consequences for motivation, affect, learning or memory processes important for drug abuse and the addictive process. this initiative promotes mechanistic research using animal models at the behavioral, genetic, molecular, cellular, circuit and systems levels to investigate changes produced by exercise or physical activity that can be related to drug abuse and addiction. applications considered responsive to this foa will be those employing animal models that (1) best mimic essential features of the addictive process and (2) manipulate physical activity in an experimental design that has translational implications for human intervention noting that paradigms employing acute drug administration and one time exercise experiences are those least likely to yield relevant information for problems of abuse and addiction. lastly, applicants should consider that exercise alters the energy balance in an organism, and the effects of altered feeding on neural outcomes should be separated from those of physical activity and/or exposure to abused substances. research areas of interest include but are not limited to the following questions: at the behavioral level, exercise can be introduced prior to onset of the behavior of interest (e.g., conditioned place preference, drug self-administration, choice between drug and natural rewards, etc.), during or concomitant with ongoing drug maintained behavior, or at critical points of escalation or relapse. does exercise or physical activity alter vulnerability or resilience to drug use and thus serve as a possible model for intervention? what behavioral and/or neurobiological mechanisms are responsible for these effects? are choice behavior paradigms useful for the study of relative reinforcing properties of physical activity versus drugs of abuse? is exercise an effective alternative reinforcer and what parameters produce optimal results? are the neurobiological changes associated with drug abuse behavior different than those produced by exercise? are there additive or synergistic effects, assessed behaviorally or in terms of underlying neurobiological substrates? does exercise interfere with the development of neuroadaptations seen over repeated drug use? does exercise induce similar or overlapping adaptations at the biochemical and morphological levels? what are the functional consequences of these alterations for the development of addictive processes? what is the relationship between the phenotype for behavioral activity level and behavioral and neurobiological outcomes related to drug abuse? does stress mediate the effects of exercise in models of drug abuse and addiction? what impact does exercise have upon the homeostatic dysregulation and stress that accompanies withdrawal from drugs of abuse? additionally, what are the consequences for continued drug use and/or relapse behavior? does response to exercise predict drug abuse behavior or are the phenotypes that predict reinforcing effects of exercise and those for addiction vulnerability overlapping? does physical activity interact with phenotypes that have been associated with drug use vulnerability (for example, impulsivity or novelty-seeking)? does response to exercise predict drug abuse behavior or are the phenotypes that predict reinforcing effects of exercise and those for addiction vulnerability overlapping? does physical activity interact with phenotypes that have been associated with drug use vulnerability (for example, impulsivity or novelty-seeking)? in all the above studies, are there sex differences and developmental differences? do gonadal hormones play a role?

RFA-AG-11-002,ii. award information 1. mechanism of support this funding opportunity will use the p30 award mechanism(s). the project director/principal investigator (pd/pi) will be solely responsible for planning, directing, and executing the proposed project. this foa uses just-in-time information concepts. it also uses non-modular budget formats described in the phs 398 application instructions (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.html ). 2. funds available the estimated amount of funds available to be awarded as a result of this announcement is approximately $ 3.3 million in fiscal year 2011 for support of three new or renewal centers and $1.1 million in fiscal year 2012 for support of one new or renewal center. the maximum allowable direct cost that may be requested is $800,000 per year. an applicant may request a project period of up to 5 years. future year amounts will depend on annual appropriations. because the nature and scope of the proposed research will vary from application to application, it is anticipated that the size and duration of each award will also vary. although the financial plans of nia provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds and the receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. facilities and administrative costs requested by consortium participants are not included in the direct cost limitation, see not-od-05-004 . nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made in response to this foa. section
RFA-CA-07-016,ii. award information 1. mechanism of support this foa will use the nih exploratory/developmental phase ii grant (r33) award mechanism . as an applicant, you will be solely responsible for planning, directing, and executing the proposed project. this funding opportunity uses just-in-time concepts. applicants must complete and submit detailed budget requests using the sf424 research and related (r&r) budget component provided in the sf424 (r&r) application package and sf424 (r&r) application guide (see specifically section 4.7, r&r budget component, of the application guide). modular budgets are not permitted for this funding opportunity. exploratory/developmental grant support is for new projects only; competing renewal (formerly competing continuation ) applications will not be accepted. up to two resubmissions (formerly revisions/amendments") of a previously reviewed exploratory/developmental grant application may be submitted. see not-od-03-041 , may 7, 2003. 2. funds available because the nature and scope of the proposed research will vary from application to application, it is anticipated that the size and duration of each award will also vary. although the financial plans of the nci provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. the nci intends to commit a total of approximately up to $1,500,000 to this foa in fy 2007 to award up to 4-5 grants in response to this foa. an r33 applicant may request a project period of up to 3 years with a combined budget appropriate for the science proposed. the request should be tailored to the needs of the project. commensurate facilities and administrative (f&a) costs are allowed. nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made in response to this funding opportunity. f&a costs requested by consortium participants are not included in the direct cost limitation. see not-od-05-004 , november 2, 2004. all awards are subject to the availability of funds. the estimated amount of funds available for support of projects awarded as a result of this announcement is up to $1,500,000 for fiscal year 2007. future year amounts will depend on annual appropriations. section
RFA-CA-07-020,ii. collaborations with other applicants to this rfa. although not required, two or more laboratories responding to this rfa may propose to take an integrated approach to specific aspects of glycan biomarker discovery and development. such plans should be briefly described in this section. whereas such interactions may benefit the entire program, it is imperative that projects proposed by each of the collaborating laboratories are individually coherent and viable as self-standing projects. each application will be individually evaluated for its scientific merit. c. data and resource sharing plans - section 3 should also contain plans for sharing of: 1) data; and 2) research resources. please see instructions below for the preparation of these plans. plan for sharing research data all applicants must include a plan for sharing research data in their application. the data sharing policy is available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing . all investigators responding to this funding opportunity should include a description of how final research data will be shared, or explain why data sharing is not possible. the precise content of the data-sharing plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. applicants must describe briefly the expected schedule for data sharing, the format of the final dataset, the documentation to be provided, whether or not any analytic tools also will be provided, whether or not a data-sharing agreement will be required and, if so, a brief description of such an agreement (including the criteria for deciding who can receive the data and whether or not any conditions will be placed on their use), and the mode of data sharing (e.g., under their own auspices by mailing a disk or posting data on their institutional or personal website, through a data archive or enclave). investigators choosing to share under their own auspices may wish to enter into a data-sharing agreement. references to data sharing may also be appropriate in other sections of the application. the data sharing plan must describe how that institution intends to meet the nih policies for sharing of data or why data sharing is not possible. all investigators funded by this initiative will be required to submit any novel glycan structures elucidated under this program to the glycan structure database of the consortium for functional glycomics. likewise, glycan profiles obtained from control and disease tissues, or cells, or other biospecimens will have to be deposited with the cfg’s glycoprofiling database . experimental data for sharing, their format, analytical algorithms, computational modeling and visualizations, and other bioinformatics tools resulting from this rfa must be compatible with the nih-approved bioinformatics platforms, such as those designed and implemented by the nci center for bioinformatics ( http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov ), ultimately including cabig, an open source/open access information network for the sharing of cancer research data and related software tools ( https://cabig.nci.nih.gov ). the consortium for functional glycomics (cfg) and cabig representatives will work on implementing appropriate schemes for inclusion of data elements related to complex carbohydrate structures into cabig. the funded tumor glycan laboratories are expected to adhere to ensuing recommendations and standards for such inclusion once they become available. the reasonableness of the data sharing plan or the rationale for not sharing research data will be assessed by the reviewers. however, reviewers will not factor the proposed data sharing plan into the determination of scientific merit or the priority score. sharing research resources nih policy requires that grant awardee recipients make unique research resources readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community after publication (see the nih grants policy statement at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/index.htm and at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/nihgps_part7.htm#_toc54600131 ). investigators responding to this funding opportunity should include a plan for sharing research resources addressing how unique research resources will be shared or explain why sharing is not possible. the adequacy of the resources sharing plan and any related data sharing plans will be considered by program staff of the funding organization when making recommendations about funding applications. the effectiveness of the resource sharing will be evaluated as part of the administrative review of each non-competing grant progress report (phs 2590, http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/2590/2590.htm ). see section vi.3. reporting . investigators conducting biomedical research frequently develop unique research resources. nih recognizes that certain research activities may result in inventions and that grantees are entitled to protect such inventions through patenting and licensing activities in accordance with the bayh-dole act, 35 usc 200 et seq. and the implementing regulations, 37 cfr part 401 ( bayh-dole act ). however, the alliance’s core mission is based on collaborations among alliance members and between alliance members and industry partners. these interactions necessitate the sharing of research resources developed in alliance-related activities. to assure that the resulting research resources are accessible to other members of the alliance, nih requires that applicants who respond to this rfa: (1) submit a plan for sharing the unique research resources, e.g., glycomic reagents or probes and novel cancer biomarkers, generated through the grant; and (2) address how they will exercise intellectual property rights, should any be generated through this grant. if applicant investigators plan to collaborate with third parties owning intellectual property rights to a necessary technology, they must explain how such collaborations will be arranged so as not to restrict their ability to share research materials produced with nih funding. clinical terms of awards the nci is developing a policy that will require clinical terms of awards for clinical studies and trials when they are a component of the proposed research. the policy will require that studies be monitored commensurate with the degree of potential risk to study subjects and the complexity of the study. the new policy will be posted in the nih guide within a few weeks. all funded applicants will be expected to adhere to the new policy. section v. application review information 1. criteria only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. the following will be considered in making funding decisions: scientific merit of the proposed project as determined by peer review; availability of funds; and relevance of program priorities. 2. review and selection process applications that are complete and responsive to the rfa will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate peer review group convened by nci in accordance with the review criteria stated below. as part of the initial merit review, all applications will: undergo a selection process in which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific merit, generally the top half of applications under review, will be discussed and assigned a priority score; receive a written critique; and receive a second level of review by the national cancer advisory board. the goals of nih supported research are to advance our understanding of biological systems, to improve the control of disease, and to enhance health. in their written critiques, reviewers will be asked to comment on each of the following criteria in order to judge the likelihood that the proposed research will have a substantial impact on the pursuit of these goals. each of these criteria will be addressed and considered in assigning the overall score, weighting them as appropriate for each application. note that an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact and thus deserve a high priority score. for example, an investigator may propose to carry out important work that by its nature is not innovative but is essential to move a field forward. significance: does this study address an important problem? if the aims of the application are achieved, how will scientific knowledge or clinical practice be advanced? what will be the effect of these studies on the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? does the proposed project focus on exploiting complex carbohydrates as cancer biomarkers for early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, recurrence, or risk? does the study address an important clinical problem in oncology? if the aims of the application are achieved, will clinical tests for these biomarkers be feasible? approach: are the conceptual or clinical framework, design, methods, and analyses adequately developed, well integrated, well reasoned, and appropriate to the aims of the project? does the applicant acknowledge potential problem areas and consider alternative tactics? is there evidence that the applicant group is capable of anticipating new directions in this field and of channeling resources to new opportunities? innovation: is the project original and innovative? for example: does the project challenge existing paradigms or address an innovative hypothesis or critical barrier to progress in the field? does the project develop and/or employ novel concepts, approaches, methodologies, tools, and/or technologies for this area? investigators: are the investigators appropriately trained and well suited to carry out this work? is the work proposed appropriate to the experience level of the principal investigator and other researchers? does the investigative team bring complementary and integrated expertise to the project (if applicable)? is the pi appropriately trained and well suited to lead and coordinate a research program of this nature? does the investigative team bring complementary and integrated expertise to the project? is the work proposed appropriate to the experience level of the pi and other researchers? do the team members have a significant track record of collaborations within and outside the applicant institution? are the applicants willing to collaborate extensively and share information fully and to abide by the priorities and policies agreed upon by the cu? environment: does the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? do the proposed experiments take advantage of unique features of the scientific environment and/or employ useful collaborative arrangements? is there evidence of institutional support? 2.a. additional review criteria in addition to the above criteria, the following items will continue to be considered in the determination of scientific merit and the priority score: protection of human subjects from research risk: the involvement of human subjects and protections from research risk relating to their participation in the proposed research will be assessed (see the research plan, section e on human subjects in the phs form 398). inclusion of women, minorities and children in research: the adequacy of plans to include subjects from both genders, all racial and ethnic groups (and subgroups), and children as appropriate for the scientific goals of the research will be assessed. plans for the recruitment and retention of subjects will also be evaluated (see the research plan, section e on human subjects in the phs form 398). care and use of vertebrate animals in research: if vertebrate animals are to be used in the project, the five items described under section f of the phs form 398 research grant application instructions will be assessed. biohazards: if materials or procedures are proposed that are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, determine if the proposed protection is adequate. 2.b. additional review considerations budget: the reasonableness of the proposed budget and the requested period of support in relation to the proposed research. the priority score should not be affected by the evaluation of the budget. 2.c. sharing research data data sharing plan: the reasonableness of the data sharing plan or the rationale for not sharing research data will be assessed by the reviewers. however, reviewers will not factor the proposed data sharing plan into the determination of scientific merit or the priority score. the presence of a data sharing plan will be part of the terms and conditions of the award. the funding organization will be responsible for monitoring the data sharing policy. 2.d. sharing research resources nih policy requires that grant awardee recipients make unique research resources readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community after publication (see the nih grants policy statement at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/part_ii_5.htm#availofrr and at http://www.ott.nih.gov/policy/rt_guide_final.html ). investigators responding to this funding opportunity should include a sharing research resources plan addressing how unique research resources will be shared or explain why sharing is not possible. program staff will be responsible for the administrative review of the plan for sharing research resources. the adequacy of the resources sharing plan will be considered by program staff of the funding organization when making recommendations about funding applications. program staff may negotiate modifications of the data and resource sharing plans with the awardee before recommending funding of an application. the final version of the data and resource sharing plans negotiated by both will become a condition of the award of the grant. the effectiveness of the resource sharing will be evaluated as part of the administrative review of each non-competing grant progress report (phs 2590). see section vi.3. reporting . 3. anticipated announcement and award dates not applicable section vi. award administration information 1. award notices after the peer review of the application is completed, the pd/pi will be able to access his or her summary statement (written critique) via the era commons . if the application is under consideration for funding, nih will request "just-in-time" information from the applicant. for details, applicants may refer to the nih grants policy statement part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart a: general ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/nihgps_part4.htm ). a formal notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document. once all administrative and programmatic issues have been resolved, the noa will be generated via e-mail notification from the awarding component to the grantee business official (designated in item 12 on the application face page). if a grantee is not e-mail enabled, a hard copy of the noa will be mailed to the business official. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. see also section iv.5. funding restrictions . 2. administrative and national policy requirements all nih grant and cooperative agreement awards include the nih grants policy statement as part of the noa. for these terms of award, see the nih grants policy statement part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart a: general ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/nihgps_part4.htm ) and part ii terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart b: terms and conditions for specific types of grants, grantees, and activities ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/nihgps_part9.htm ). the following terms and conditions will be incorporated into the award statement and will be provided to the pi as well as to the appropriate institutional official, at the time of award. 2.a. cooperative agreement terms and conditions of award the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable omb administrative guidelines, dhhs grant administration regulations at 45 cfr parts 74 and 92 (part 92 is applicable when state and local governments are eligible to apply), and other dhhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement ( u01 ), an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the nih as defined above. the alliance of glycobiologists for detection of cancer and cancer risk will be comprised of several components: tumor glycome laboratories(tgl); the consortium for functional glycomics (cfg) funded by nigms; glycomics and glycotechnology resource centers funded by ncrr; and the early detection research network (edrn) funded by nci. the activities within the alliance will be integrated by its governing body, termed the coordination unit (cu). 2.a.1. principal investigator rights and responsibilities the pi will have the primary responsibility for coordinating all project activities scientifically and administratively at the awardee institution and with any collaborating institutions. the pi will assume accountability to officials of the awardee organization and to the nci for the performance and the proper conduct of the research supported by the u01 mechanism in accordance with the terms and conditions stated in the rfa. the pi will also operate in close coordination with the nci project scientist and cu in integrating his/her program with the broader scope of the alliance and be responsible for accepting and implementing the goals, priorities, procedures, and policies agreed upon by the cu. the pi will have the primary authority and responsibility to: define objectives and approaches, including research design and study development; coordinate activities of the components of his/her team, oversee data collection and quality control; and oversee data analysis and publication of the results. the pi will assume responsibility for managing collaborative projects approved by the cu. the pi will serve as a voting member of the cu, will attend the annual cu meeting, and participate in regular conference calls designated for alliance activities. in addition, the pi will attend at least one edrn- or cfg-sponsored meeting per year. attendance at these meetings is considered an essential part of the grant. the pi will be responsible for collaborating on common research designs or protocols, including methods and requirements for joint participation and collaboration as directed by the cu, and handling of data, including appropriate sharing of methods and data among collaborating organizations and submission of validation study protocols to the data management and coordinating center of edrn. the pi will be responsible for ensuring compatibility of pertinent bioinformatics data with nih-recommended standards, as described previously under plan for sharing research data of this rfa ca-07-020 . the pi will also be responsible for submission of novel glycan structures and glycomic profiles to the cfg for inclusion in its databases. awardees will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to federal government rights of access consistent with current dhhs, phs, and nih policies. 2.a.2. nih responsibilities an nih (nci) project scientist will have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below. the nci project scientist will have substantial scientific programmatic involvement during conduct of this activity, through technical assistance, initiation of collaborative projects, data sharing and analysis, composition of reports, and coordination with other research activities within the alliance or edrn. because of the alliance’s diverse research agenda, and the number of tasks that have to be accomplished to achieve its goals, nih staff members from nigms and ncrr will participate as needed to effectively foster necessary interactions between tumor glycome laboratories and various resource components of the alliance. a member from the biometry branch, division of cancer prevention, nci, will be available to assist the alliance on issues of study design, sample size, and other statistical computations. other nci staff may assist and advise the alliance on relevant programmatic and scientific issues through the nci project scientist. the project scientist will convene the initial meeting of the cu, and will be a voting member of the cu. additionally, an nci program official (not the person who will serve as the nci project scientist) will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice (i.e., the noa). 2.a.3. collaborative responsibilities coordination unit (cu): the cu will have major scientific management oversight and responsibility for developing collaborative research designs, protocols, facilitating the conduct and monitoring of studies, and reporting study results. all awardees will be required to accept and implement policies approved by the cu. the cu will be composed of the following full members: the pis from each tumor glycome laboratory of the alliance; one assignee from the cfg and one assignee from the edrn (the assignee may be either the chair, co-chair of the respective steering committees or other designated person); the nci project scientist; and a program director from the nigms . a program director from the ncrr. each full member will have one vote. the chair will be selected by the cu from among the pis of the tumor glycome laboratories. subcommittees or working groups will be established and maintained by the cu, as it deems appropriate; the nih cu members will serve on subcommittees as they deem appropriate. after all the alliance tumor glycome laboratories have been funded, the cu will convene and continue to meet on an annual basis. responsibilities of the cu include, but are not limited to: updating and refining established policies and procedures including those for collaborative projects, protocols, and alliance-defined projects; updating and refining established policies and procedures for reviewing changes in projects not showing translational significance at the request of the laboratories/centers; making recommendations to the nci for adjusting the scientific scope of funded projects; establishing procedures for submission of requests and allocations of collaborative resource funds; updating and refining established standards or decision criteria for validating biomarkers/reagents for further clinical studies, such as testing early detection strategies, or as risk factors; and updating and refining established policies and procedures for accepting, reviewing, and recommending proposals from investigators outside the alliance for collaborative research funds. the cu will promote and foster the inclusion of women and ethnic minorities in clinical validation studies and assure the completeness of informed consent. the cu will track alliance research progress and oversee the process of preparing the results of laboratory investigations and clinical studies for publication in peer-reviewed journals to ensure its timely manner and adherence to the publication policies of the alliance. the cu may also evaluate the validation data for biomarkers/reagents developed by the alliance, and decide when a biomarker is sufficiently validated, or recommend when to stop non-productive experiments relating to biomarker validation. data on testing clinical specimens will be submitted centrally to the edrn data management and coordinating center. the cu will define the rules regarding access to data and publications consistent with nci policies. the edrn data management and coordinating center will manage the logistics for the annual cu meetings. the cu, in consultation with the nci, will determine the pi of any alliance-wide validation study. collaborative resource funds: after the cu is formed and elects its chair, collaborative resource funds (cr funds) in the amount of $500,000 for the first year and $700,000 in subsequent years will be made available by the nci office of grants administration (oga) as a separately administered item in the cu chair’s award. the chair’s institution will not receive facilities and administrative (indirect) costs on the cr funds. the cr funds are reserved for post-award necessities of the alliance as listed below: cr funds can be allocated for the development of special resources needed by the alliance (for example, to enhance the resource capabilities of the cfg or ncrr carbohydrate research centers so as to enable special technologies to be used by the alliance). cr funds can be used to advance or expand the proposed research objectives of tumor glycome laboratories by subsidizing the procurement of reagents, services, or other resources offered by cfg or ncrr carbohydrate research centers. in addition, cr funds may support collection of clinical specimens for use by tumor glycome laboratories. cr fund requests by a pi for any of these purposes must be submitted to the cu. cr funds will support data analysis provided by the data management and coordinating center of edrn. the cu will be responsible for how cr funds are used. consensus of the cu for allocating cr funds for specific purposes will be determined by a majority vote. supplements from the cr funds will provide direct and appropriate facilities and administrative costs. there is flexibility to permit investigators outside the alliance to collaborate with a tumor glycome laboratory or bring their promising discoveries or platforms for inclusion in the research activities of the alliance. to support such efforts, the cu may allocate cr funds to supplement the investigator’s ongoing research provided that the focus of this collaboration is to meet the objectives of the alliance as specified in this rfa. the investigator, in turn must agree to share his/her research findings and participate in alliance research meetings and conference calls. recipients of cr funds that are outside the alliance, such as commercial laboratories, industrial partners, and outside investigators will be subjected to the resource sharing and intellectual property requirements set forth in section 6 of this rfa ca-07-020 under sharing research resources . awardees must advise cr fund recipients of these requirements. 2.a.4. arbitration process any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to arbitration. an arbitration panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the cu chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. this special arbitration procedure in no way affects the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulations 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and hhs regulations 45 cfr part 16. 3. reporting awardees will be required to submit the phs non-competing grant progress report, form 2590 annually ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/2590/2590.htm ) and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement. the nci is developing a policy that will require clinical terms of awards for clinical studies and trials when they are a component of the proposed research. the policy will require that studies be monitored commensurate with the degree of potential risk to study subjects and the complexity of the study. the new policy will be posted in the nih guide within a few weeks. all funded applicants will be expected to adhere to the new policy. section vii. agency contacts we

RFA-MH-18-510,section ii.7 of the brain 2025 report. specifically, this foa solicits applications from early-stage postdoctorates to acquire mentored research training using cutting-edge tools, theories and/or approaches in one of the seven, high-priority areas of the brain initiative including neuroethics. given the expressed need to bring those trained in quantitative disciplines to neuroscience research, applications from individuals obtaining terminal doctorates in quantitative disciplines are encouraged. for brain initiative awards to date, see http://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/funding/fundedawards.htm . specific objectives of this foa the integrated program of research and training supported by this foa is intended for postdoctorates who are early in their postdoctoral training period in a given laboratory or research environment, rather than for advanced postdoctorates. support for early postdoctoral training will maximize the training potential of this fellowship award. given the interval when applications will be accepted (from 12 months prior to completing terminal degree requirements to 12 months after starting postdoctoral training), it is recognized that some applicants are unlikely to have had the opportunity to generate preliminary data for the proposed project. accordingly, it is expected that there will be no preliminary data in the application, although inclusion of preliminary data is permissible. the proposed research and training plan should focus on a research area and/or skill set that clearly and strongly complements the applicant's existing research expertise and skills and that will markedly broaden the applicant's knowledge and skills. for example, an applicant with existing skills in molecular neuroscience might propose a research training plan that emphasizes circuit-level neuroscience approaches to brain function. an applicant with existing neuroscience training might propose a research training plan that emphasizes neuroethics. an applicant trained in physics or statistics might propose a research training plan that emphasizes data-intensive/computational approaches to neuroscience. an applicant with research experience using non-human vertebrate animals might propose a research training plan using human subjects. the application should consist of a well-conceived scientific project, integrated with a comprehensive training plan, which is designed by a collaborative discussion between the applicant fellow and sponsor. in addition to preparing the candidate to be a subject matter expert in the proposed research area and to acquire new technical skills, the research and training plans are expected to provide the candidate with a strong understanding of the principles of experimental design and the tools for rigorous analytical approaches. given that neuroethics research may involve analysis of large qualitative data sets, applicants proposing research in this domain are expected to propose didactics and training that will develop state-of-the-art analytical skills appropriate for such data sets. in contrast, applicants proposing experimental neuroscience research and/or modeling are expected to propose didactics and training that will enable them to develop state-of-the-art quantitative skills, the principles of quantitative analysis, and to incorporate quantitative approaches that are appropriate to answer the proposed research question. applicants proposing a computational/modeling project are encouraged to gain exposure to the biological approaches from which the data sets they'll model are derived. further, the proposed research and training plan should enhance the individual's potential to develop into a productive, independent researcher by providing committed mentorship, appropriate training and career development opportunities, and strong institutional support. the training plan should document the need for, and the anticipated value of, the proposed mentored training in relationship to the individual's research career goals and the individual's prior research training. the training plan should be explicitly designed to prepare the fellow to transition to the next stage of his/her research career. it is expected that the mentored training experience will provide: a strong foundation in quantitative reasoning, research design, methods, statistics and analytic techniques appropriate to the proposed research and sufficient to ensure that the applicant has the knowledge and skills to generate robust and reproducible data; experience conducting research using appropriate, state-of-the-art tools and approaches relevant to the goals of the brain initiative, and an expert understanding of the tools and methods used; opportunities to present research findings at national meetings as the work progresses; opportunities to publish the research findings as first author; opportunities to interact with members of the scientific community at appropriate scientific meetings and workshops including brain initiative investigator meetings; and professional skills needed to transition to the next stage of the applicant's research career. to be considered responsive to this foa, the proposed research training plan must be relevant to the scientific goals of the brain 2025 report, as described in the required other attachment for this application (see section iv.2. sf424(r&r) other project information below). applications that are not relevant to one or more goals of the brain 2025 report will not be reviewed. pre-submission consultation applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with nih scientific/research staff when planning an application. early contact provides an opportunity for nih scientific/research staff to provide guidance on program scope and appropriateness of the proposed research and training for potential funding in response to this foa. applicants should contact nih scientific/research staff as early as possible before the due date. pre-submission technical assistance webinar a technical assistance webinar will be held for potential applicants on tuesday, december 12, 2017 at 1:00-2:30pm est. the intent of the webinar is to provide an overview of the foa and to address questions pertinent to preparing an application. participation in the webinar, although encouraged, is optional and is not required for application submission. to obtain access information, please email brain.initiative.training@nih.gov at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled webinar and specify "brain f32 webinar" in the subject line of the email. access information will be sent the day before the webinar. prospective applicants are encouraged to submit their questions or comments regarding the foa to brain.initiative.training@nih.gov at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled webinar. please indicate "brain f32 webinar" in the subject line of your email. note : this funding opportunity announcement (foa) does not allow applicants to propose to lead an independent clinical trial, but does allow applicants to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a sponsor or co-sponsor.
RFA-DK-06-004,ii. award information 1. mechanism of support this foa uses just-in-time concepts. it also uses the modular budget formats (see the modular applications and awards section of the nih grants policy statement . specifically, if you are submitting an application with direct costs in each year of $250,000 or less (excluding consortium facilities and administrative [f&a] costs), use the phs398 modular budget component provided in the sf424 (r&r) application package and sf424 (r&r) application guide (see specifically section 5.4, modular budget component, of the application guide). exploratory/developmental grant support is for new projects only; competing renewal (formerly competing continuation ) applications will not be accepted. 2. funds available because the nature and scope of the proposed research will vary from application to application, it is anticipated that the size and duration of each award will also vary. although the financial plans of the institutes and centers (ics) provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. the participating organization(s), n iddk, nhlbi and nei , intend to commit approximately $3 million dollars in fy2 007 to fund 8-12 applications. at this time, it is not known if competing renewal applications will be accepted and/or if this f o a will be reissued. in most cases, an applicant may request a project period of up to 2 years and a total budget for direct costs up to $300,000 for the entire project. these projects will be funded under the special type 1 diabetes appropriation that ends in 2008. therefore, projects can only request two years of funding. an exception would be clinical studies that might request a third year at reduced costs for data analysis. applicants may request a total of $600,000 in direct costs with budgets not exceeding $250,000 in any one year for clinical studies involving expensive imaging studies or measurements on a large number of stored clinical specimens. nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made in response to this rfa . f acilities and administrative (f &a ) costs requested by consortium participants are not included in the direct cost limitation. see not-od-05-004 . section

RFA-LM-11-001,section ii. award information funding instrument grant. application types allowed new renewal the oer glossary and the sf 424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. funds available and anticipated number of awards the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations, and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. in fy 2012, nlm intends to spend approximately $14,000,000 on 10-15 awards in this program. award budget application budgets are not limited, but need to reflect actual needs of the proposed project. program budgets are primarily determined by the numbers and types of training positions requested. an applicant proposing at least one basic informatics training program, or a mix of basic and specialized training areas, with both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, may request nlm funding for a maximum of 15 full-time training positions, and a maximum of 4 diversity short-term positions, in each year. programs that wish to train only predoctoral or only postdoctoral trainees may request up to 10 full time training positions and a maximum of 2 diversity short term positions in each year. award project period the expected project period is five years, beginning july 1, 2012. awards are normally made in 12-month increments with support for additional years based on satisfactory progress and the continued availability of funds. other award budget information stipends, tuition, and fees nlm training grant awards provide stipends as a subsistence allowance to help defray living expenses during the research training experiences. the current predoctoral nlm stipend table is available at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/trainingdirectors.html . the nlm predoctoral stipend table provides support at the nrsa level in year one, with 5% escalation in years two through five. for postdoctoral trainees, nlm stipends mirror the nrsa stipend table. the current nlm postdoctoral stipend table is available at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/trainingdirectors.html . selection of the appropriate starting pay level for postdoctoral trainees depends upon the experience of the candidate. relevant experience may include research experience (including industrial), teaching, internship, residency, clinical duties, or other time spent in full-time studies in a health-related field following the date of the qualifying doctoral degree. no nlm trainee may receive more than 5 years of nlm support (in aggregate), of which no more than 3 years can be for postdoctoral training. thus, a predoctoral trainee who receives 5 years of nlm support is not eligible for postdoctoral training support from nlm. for short-term trainees, the nlm stipend equals 25% of the lowest level of the nlm predoctoral or postdoctoral stipend table. nlm will provide 60% of tuition and fees up to a limit of $16,000 per year for predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees enrolled in degree programs. for postdoctoral trainees not enrolled in degree programs, nlm will provide up to $4500 per year for tuition and fees. for short-term trainees, nlm will provide up to $4,000 for tuition and fees. the most recent stipend, tuition, and fee levels are described on the nlm web site http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/trainingdirectors.html . nlm training awards are not nrsa awards, but are similar in many ways. a notable difference is the absence of a service payback requirement. trainee travel trainee travel to attend scientific meetings and workshops that the institution determines to be necessary for the individual’s research training experience is an allowable trainee expense. nlm provides $2000 per year for travel to each full time trainee. short-term trainees do not receive travel support. all full-time nlm trainees are expected to attend the annual nlm training conference held each summer. after supporting travel to the nlm training conference, travel funds may be used to support trainee travel to relevant professional meetings, at the program director’s discretion. training related expenses and health insurance nlm will provide $6500 for each full-time trainee to help defray other research training expenses, such as health insurance, staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, research supplies, and faculty/staff travel directly related to the research training program. in addition, nlm provides $2,000 for predoctoral trainees and $4,000 for postdoctoral trainees to assist with costs for health insurance. the most recent levels of support for training related expenses and health insurance are available on the nlm web site at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/trainingdirectors.html . for each short-term trainee, applicants may request trainee-related expenses of $1,100 per year. under exceptional circumstances, which can include providing accommodations for a trainee with disabilities, it is possible to request additional training-related expenses. consultation with nlm program staff in advance of such requests is required. unless an applicant receives advance permission to do so, no exceptional expenses should be included in a submitted budget. indirect costs indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees and expenditures for equipment), rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement. nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made in response to this foa.

RFA-NS-17-010,ii. in the event that the candidate is making good progress during phase i, makes appropriate efforts to obtain individual funding for the start of phase ii, but fails to do so by the start of the third year of the program, an ability to continue to devote 50% effort to research is critical to the scholar’s continued progress towards success. thus, it is anticipated that the chair of the scholar’s home department will continue to provide 50% protected time to the scholar during the entire phase ii period, when appropriate. because protected time for research is critical for a candidate s success, the nrcdp is strongly encouraged to request a description of the home department’s commitment to the candidate’s research effort in the candidate s application to the program. the nrcdp is generally not intended to provide financial support during the third year of the scholar's program. however, limited financial help during the third year may be provided in exceptional cases, at the discretion of the pd/pi, in consultation with the nac. for the first two new applicants supported each year, support from this program may be used only for individuals who move to a new institution following their residency. if more than two applicants are supported in a given year, these additional candidates may be selected from neurosurgeons who remain in a faculty position at their residency institution. in addition, all neurosurgeons, regardless of institution or career stage, may be invited to participate in the nrcdp meeting, even when not funded as a k12 scholar by the nrcdp program. institutional environment and commitment to the program the chair of the scholar's home department plays a critical role in the success of the nrcdp. the program is designed to directly support relatively few scholars, with the goal that all of those supported will go on to successful, dual careers as clinical neurosurgeons and productive, well-funded researchers. in order to launch such a career, scholars need a period of outstanding training and mentoring as well as adequate protected time to successfully conduct high quality research and obtain independent funding. consequently, for a successful application to the nrcdp program, chairs must commit to allowing the scholar to spend a minimum of 50% of full time professional effort on research activities for the nrcdp support period. moreover, if an nrcdp scholar is making appropriate progress towards developing a research program, it is anticipated that chairs will continue to provide 50% protected time for research for the entire 5 year nrcdp period. in addition, chairs should make every effort to provide appropriate resources and support, in whatever form needed, to ensure success of the scholar. it should be anticipated that the nrcdp program will make at least one site visit to each scholar's home department to discuss with the scholar, mentor(s), chair and others involved in the scholar's activities, the scholar's progress, needs and any other relevant issues. special note : the pd/pi is strongly encouraged to work closely with the designated ninds staff to maximize the success of the program in achieving the goals of this foa. potential applicants should contact the ninds director of training, career development and workforce diversity with any questions about this program, program planning or application for this award.

RFA-EY-18-001,ii.3, and ii.4 from the brain 2025 report. these three recommendations call for accelerated development of new large-scale recording technologies and tools for neural circuit manipulation. these new technologies and approaches will provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring how the nervous system encodes, processes, utilizes, stores, and retrieves vast quantities of information. a better understanding of this dynamic neural activity will enable researchers to seek new ways to diagnose, treat, and prevent brain disorders. achieving these goals requires the ability to record simultaneously from thousands or tens-of- thousands of neurons contributing to the dynamic activity in a neural circuit. the relevant activity may be in clusters of cells packed closely together or may be in widely distributed circuits. current microelectrode and imaging technologies are limited in the number of cells from which activity can be isolated and sampled simultaneously, by the size or location of the area to be sampled, by the depth of penetration, and by the invasiveness of the technique that might prohibit their use in human experimentation. non-invasive technologies suitable for use in humans are currently limited in spatial resolution and temporal dynamics, as well as in their reflection of on-going electrical activity in circuit elements. this foa seeks entirely new ideas, concepts and/or approaches from physics and engineering, and biology, for how these limitations might be overcome to enable increased recording capabilities on the scale of one or more orders of magnitude beyond that of current technology. this foa also seeks novel ideas for technology capable of manipulating activity in circuits that overcome the limitations of current invasive and non-invasive approaches. dissecting the function of neural circuits requires the ability to manipulate neural activity in order to investigate underlying mechanisms and demonstrate causality. current technologies such as microstimulation and optogenetic approaches are limited in specificity, temporal dynamics, and by the invasiveness of the technique. applications are expected to propose the development of ideas in the earliest stages for entirely new approaches for large-scale neural recording and/or manipulation of neural activity. such ideas could encompass unique and innovative combinations of existing technology that create a synergistic result. an important goal is to stimulate new thinking and concepts for accelerating development of novel technologies that break current barriers to neural recording and/or manipulation. in addition to experimental approaches, this foa may support early-stage testing using calculations, simulations, computational models, or other mathematical techniques for demonstrating that the signal sources and/or measurement technologies are theoretically capable of meeting the demands of large-scale recording or manipulation of circuit activity in humans or animal models. the support might also be used for building and testing phantoms, prototypes, in-vitro or other bench-top models in order to validate underlying theoretical assumptions in preparation for future foas aimed at proof-of concept testing in animal models. applications are expected to propose research that will explore ideas in their earliest stages of development in order to be responsive to goals and objectives of this foa. the following topics are non-responsive applications i: i) further development of existing technology; ii)

document. a. stipends the nih will provide a stipend for each trainee position according to nih guidelines and current stipend levels. the stipend is provided as a subsistence allowance for trainees to help defray living expenses during the research training experience. the stipend is not a payment for services performed. stipends must be paid to all trainees at the level approved by the secretary of the dhhs. stipend levels are adjusted periodically, and current stipend levels are available on the nih website at: https://grants.nih.gov/training/nrsa.htm . the total stipend must be based on a 12-month appointment. the institution may supplement, from non-federal sources only, the nih stipend up to a level that is consistent with the institution’s scale. the total stipend must be consistent with the level of effort, with the established stipend structure at the institution, and with stipends actually provided by the institution, from its own funds, to other staff members with equivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the same department. stipends for short-term research trainees will be based on a monthly proportion of the annual nih stipend level at the time of award. the fy ’05 annual stipend level for a predoctoral trainee is $20,772, therefore the monthly stipend is $1,731 per month. for postdoctoral trainees, the annual stipend is determined based on the number of years of prior relevant postdoctoral experience at the time of the trainee’s appointment. b. tuition, fees and health insurance applicant organizations can request funds for tuition. for the purposes of the nrsa programs, tuition is defined as the combined costs of tuition, fees and applicable health insurance. current nih policies provide support to help offset the

RFA-DK-11-015,ii. center structure and activities the niddk diabetes research centers are part of an integrated program of research support designed to enhance multidisciplinary cutting-edge research in diabetes and in related areas of endocrinology and metabolism. diabetes research centers are intended to improve the efficiency and collaborative nature of diabetes research by providing shared access to specialized technical resources and expertise. in addition, centers enhance translational research by providing a framework for fostering synergy between basic scientists and clinical investigators, with the goal of promoting rapid progress toward a treatment or cure for diabetes and its complications. diabetes research centers support three primary research-related activities: (1) research core services that provide resources to enhance the efficiency, productivity, and multidisciplinary nature of research in designated topic areas; (2) a pilot and feasibility program designed to foster the development of new investigators and to provide seed-support for innovative high-risk projects; and (3) an enrichment program to promote interdisciplinary interaction and training of investigators in areas of niddk interest. institution and research base a diabetes research center must be an identifiable unit within a single institution such as a university medical center, or within a consortium of cooperating institutions. in either case, diabetes center applications must be associated with an existing program of excellence in biomedical research in diabetes and in related areas of metabolism and endocrinology. program excellence is measured through a consistent and outstanding record of productivity and peer-reviewed research funding in diabetes and related research areas. a high level of integration and close collaboration among center personnel from diverse scientific disciplines is an important feature of a successful diabetes research center. accordingly, the applicant should clearly state considerations for center membership with specific reference to the potential of members to form interactive, collaborative and synergistic relationships. center applicants should identify one or more central themes or focus areas that link center investigators and their research programs. diabetes research often requires the use of specialized technologies and resources to support a cohesive research effort. the goal of the diabetes research center program is to make state-of-the art technologies and resources readily accessible to a broad spectrum of investigators who are pursuing studies in relevant topic areas. administrative core diabetes research center applications must include an administrative core that will be responsible for allocation and oversight of center resources. the administrative core will also be responsible for planning an enrichment program and for implementing a process for solicitation, review and selection of projects for the pilot and feasibility program within the center. in addition, all diabetes research centers will be required to maintain a center website, with the administrative core taking primary responsibility for its curation and oversight, as well as for ensuring proper and seamless integration of the center website with the niddk center program website. the core center director should provide at least 1.2 person months (calendar year) effort on the administrative core and a total of 2.4 person months (calendar year) effort distributed among the administrative and other components of the center. one or more associate directors should be named who will be involved in the administrative, scientific, or training efforts of the center and who will serve as acting center director in the absence of the director. a process must be in place that would be used to recommend a successor to the director, if needed. an administrative assistant may also be proposed. biomedical resource cores diabetes research centers are designed around research cores that provide shared, specialized technical resources and/or expertise that enhance the efficiency, productivity, and multidisciplinary nature of research performed by center-affiliated investigators. in a diabetes research center, cores are intended to facilitate basic, clinical and translational research in diabetes, endocrinology and metabolic diseases in order to accomplish the stated goals of the individual center and of the niddk centers program. each research core should provide state-of-the art services to multiple funded research projects. a center may support research at a single or set of cooperating institutions through an institutional core. in addition, diabetes center applicants may propose to share core services or functions with other centers in the diabetes center program in order to expand, enhance, or increase the cost-effectiveness of research activities at the center institution. examples of biomedical cores that would be considered responsive to this request for applications include, but are not limited to: genetics/genomics (including epigenetics) proteomics metabolomics islet isolation and function transgenic and es-cell technology protein chemistry and macromolecular structure analytical biochemistry integrative physiology imaging translational research (bench to bedside; bedside to community/practice) clinical research bioinformatics biostatistics these cores are not listed in any particular order, nor do they represent a comprehensive list of possibilities. in responding to this foa, applicants are encouraged to propose cores that address specific objectives based on the unique requirements of investigators at the applicant institutions. particular emphasis should be placed on services that support and foster interdisciplinary, integrated and translational approaches to research in diabetes center topic areas. preference will be given to core support services that are not readily available or cost-effective when supplied from commercial sources, and techniques or technologies that may be technically challenging or require specialized expertise, equipment or infrastructure. proposed diabetes center research cores may be an institutional shared research core. in such cases, the research core support provided by the diabetes center should be proportional to the use of the institutional research core by diabetes research center members. as with other research cores, details about access and prioritization of center members to the shared research core(s) should be provided. moreover, the applicant should document that the diabetes center will be in a position to have some input to, and oversight of, the shared institutional core with respect to its management, planning for future changes and improvements, etc. the need for core support from the diabetes research center must be well justified, with clear documentation of a broad user base of niddk-funded investigators pursuing research activities in center topic areas, as well as diabetes investigators with other sources of peer-reviewed support. participants in the diabetes center program are encouraged to become fully integrated into, and synergistic with, other niddk- and nih-funded core centers within their institutional setting. this includes the clinical research homes being established by the clinical and translational science awards supported by the national institutes of health ( http://ctsaweb.org/ ) and other related nih roadmap activities, and any related niddk-funded center programs such as the nutrition obesity research center (norc) program http://www3.niddk.nih.gov/centers/norc.shtml ) and the centers for diabetes translation research (cdtr; http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-dk-10-009.html ). applicants should provide information on other programs supporting related resources at their institution and describe the nature of synergy and integration between the diabetes research center and these other activities. applicants must also clearly describe how duplication or redundancies of effort, services and resources will be avoided. pilot and feasibility program the diabetes research center pilot and feasibility (p&f) program provides seed support for new and innovative research projects directed at basic biomedical, clinical and translational research questions relevant to diabetes and its complications. typically at least 20-25% of the center direct costs, exclusive of equipment, should be for support of p&f projects. funding and duration of support: it is anticipated that up to $50,000 in direct costs per year for up to two years will be provided for the majority of approved p&f projects. however, a limited number of applications may be selected for support as enhanced p&f awards with prior niddk approval. enhanced p&f awards require prior approval from niddk and will be selected from worthy proposals in the following three project categories: clinical and translational research awards, clinical and basic research innovative partnership awards, or technology research and development awards. these enhanced awards may be funded at up to $100,000 direct costs per year and for up to 2 years. efforts to increase the number of p&f awards and availability of funds for the program through the use of program income or alternative funding sources are particularly encouraged. eligibility: the p&f program is particularly directed at new investigators and established investigators new to diabetes research. established diabetes investigators pursuing high impact/high risk projects or projects that are a significant departure from their usual work are also eligible for support under the diabetes research center p&f program. p&f programs may also be structured to provide support for establishing interdisciplinary collaborations and to help forge new partnerships between basic scientists and clinical researchers. while the distribution of p&f funds to be used in each award category is ultimately at the discretion of the center p&f committee, it is expected that the center p&f program will, where possible, place particular emphasis on funding innovative clinical and translational research projects. named new investigator [optional] each diabetes research center may provide salary support for a p&f project recipient whom they designate a named new investigator. support for this individual is generally for 2 years, and cannot exceed $90,000 per year, additional appropriate fringe benefits, and 9.0 to 12.0 calendar months effort. these funds are included in the administrative core budget, and the initial named new investigator should be clearly identified in the application. the individual selected should be a new investigator who meets the p&f project eligibility criteria and is a permanent resident or us citizen. individuals are eligible only once for this support. subsequent candidates for this position are nominated by the center and reviewed by its external advisory board. appointment of the named new investigator is contingent upon the concurrence of the external advisory board and the niddk program director. enrichment program the diabetes research center enrichment program should be designed to advance translational research in diabetes, endocrinology and metabolism and promote scientific exchange among investigators with research interests in these topic areas, and to enhance interactions between diabetes researchers and investigators from other fields with relevant expertise. the enrichment program can support activities such as seminars, guest speakers, visiting scientists, consultants, and workshops. applicants should describe any training opportunities afforded by the diabetes research center for center participants, and document ways the center may facilitate, enhance or foster the institutional training environment. specifically, center applicants should provide information on related niddk t32 training programs at the center institution(s), and describe how the diabetes center will help to integrate, facilitate and enhance activities of t32-supported trainees. a letter from the pd/pi of any related niddk-funded t32 at the center institution should be included that acknowledges and details how the pd/pi of the t32 intends to promote cohesive interactions between the two programs. training postdoctoral fellows to conduct research in diabetes is an associated activity of a diabetes research center. while stipends for fellows cannot be funded from the center, the establishment of a center should provide an enhanced environment for research training. just as in the case of funding for individual research projects, funding for fellowships should be sought from nih nrsa institutional training grants (e.g. t32, t35) and individual fellowships (e.g. f30, f32), and other sources such as private foundations, and commercial companies.

RFA-RM-12-008,ii. to meet the proposed schedule and to determine whether the questions of feasibility and capability have been adequately addressed, nih will conduct an administrative review during the second year of the uh2 phase i study period. substantial progress will need to be demonstrated in order to be considered for scale-up to a phase ii award at the time of the administrative review that will be conducted by the h3africa staff and nih advisory councils, according to standard nih processes for administrative reviews. the decisions about continued support for phase ii will be based on the accomplishments and progress made in phase i, and the quality of the updated plans for fully implementing an international repository, which were developed in phase i and incorporated into the year 2 progress report. beyond attaining or exceeding the awardee’s stated milestones for the phase i period, the successful phase ii continuations will be those that are judged to have produced data to demonstrate the feasibility of establishing and sustaining a biorepository at their site, have the most insight into and experience overcoming the challenges of sustaining a biorepository in africa and have demonstrated a working relationship with the other h3 africa biorepository(ies) and h3africa consortium projects. while this foa indicates that the uh2 phase study will be followed by a uh3 phase ii scale-up after an administrative review, applicants should understand that the phase ii scale-up will occur only if the administrative review recommends that the phase i effort has been successful and that the phase ii scale-up can proceed with relative confidence of success. the administrative review recommendations must be endorsed by an appropriate nih council before the common fund will release funds for the phase ii award. objectives the purpose of this foa is to solicit combined applications for the uh2 phase i study and the uh3 phase ii scaled-up biorepository. uh2 phase i study: the objectives of the h3africa biorepository initial two-year uh2 phase i study are to develop a plan that will lay the foundation for establishing a biorepository to serve initially the h3africa consortium (see http://www.h3africa.org/ ) and to demonstrate the applicant’s ability to accomplish the activities that will be necessary for providing a full-scale h3africa biorepository in the uh3 phase ii. the grant application should include a description of the following for uh2 phase i: the vision for the full-scale (phase ii) biorepository, in terms of the services that will be provided and the infrastructure and capabilities that will be necessary to provide them, that the applicant will be working toward during phase i; how the applicant plans to utilize and improve the existing infrastructure at the institution, in terms of facilities, equipment, software, personnel, and scientific networking, as well as institutional and national commitment to the biorepository; how the expertise for development of sample receipt, handling, storage and distribution to the investigators within the h3africa consortium will be accomplished; the problems and obstacles that are anticipated in order to meet the challenge of serving as a biorepository to multiple investigators from multiple institutions in multiple african nations within the h3africa consortium, and how the applicant will create or take advantage of forward-looking solutions to solve those problems and overcome those obstacles; the plan during the phase i period to test or demonstrate the validity of the proposed approaches, e.g., receipt and distribution of samples within africa, and; the training in biorepository management and sciences to meet the needs of the full-scale h3africa biorepository, and subsequently enhance the expertise of african scientists in the field of genomics and/or laboratory science. uh3 phase ii scale-up: for phase ii, the grant application should address how the implementation of the biorepository will build on the plan and data generated during phase i; and how the services of the biorepository may eventually be expanded (although not necessarily within the six-year period of this award; see sustainability section) beyond the h3africa investigators to investigators elsewhere in africa and abroad. in summary: this foa calls for applications to propose a two-stage plan for an h3africa biorepository, including a two-year uh2 phase i study to develop a plan that will lay the foundation of an h3africa biorepository, and a phase ii plan to implement a scaled-up biorepository that will serve the needs of the h3africa consortium. (see http://www.h3africa.org/ ). the objectives of the phase i and ii h3africa biorepository application should describe: the plan for the full-scale biorepository that the applicant will be working toward; how the applicant plans to utilize and improve the existing infrastructure; the development of expert services for staffing the repository; solutions to anticipated problems and obstacles in order to build a repository in africa; efforts during the uh2 study phase to test or demonstrate the validity of the proposed approaches; staff training in biorepository management and science to meet the needs of biorepository. in the uh3 stage of the award, the successful project(s) will apply the proposed credible biorepository plan, approaches and tools from the uh2 phase i to the uh3 phase ii scale up. the criteria that will be used to determine which of the phase i projects will be continued into phase ii will include: successful achievement of the defined milestones for the phase i period of the project potential for meeting the goals of the initiative to establish a large-scale h3africa biorepository concrete and encouraging results and accomplishments of the feasibility activities in phase i the availability of funds h3africa program priorities and balance the h3africa biorepository application must clearly describe the objectives and plans for both the two-year phase i (supported by the uh2 mechanism, 12 page research strategy) and the four-year biorepository scale-up phase ii (supported by the continuation uh3 mechanism, 12 page research strategy). section ii. award information funding instrument cooperative agreement application types allowed new resubmission the oer glossary and the sf 424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. funds available and anticipated number of awards the nih common fund intends to commit for the uh2 (phase i) period an estimated total of $400,000 over two years for 1 to 2 uh2 grants. for the uh3 (phase ii), up to $16 million total costs for four years beyond the uh2 phase i phase will be available to support up to three full-scale biorepositories. funding per year will vary depending upon the number of biorepositories funded. . award budget up to $125,000 total costs per year for the first two years, is allowed for phase i. if only one phase i grant is awarded, the award will be adjusted. for the phase ii period the budget is limited to $2 million total costs in fy15 and $1.7 million total costs in fy16-18. the phase ii budget should be for four years total. as in the phase i grant, the amount per award per year will be adjusted depending on the number of phase ii applications awarded. a six year budget that includes both phase i and phase ii is required for the application. award project period the maximum period of funding for the entire uh/uh3 application is six years. nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made in response to this foa.

RFA-MH-17-250,section ii.7 of the brain 2025 report. specifically, this foa solicits applications from early-stage postdoctorates to acquire mentored research training using cutting-edge tools, theories and/or approaches in one of the seven, high-priority areas of the brain initiative including neuroethics. given the expressed need to bring those trained in quantitative disciplines to neuroscience research, applications from individuals obtaining terminal doctorates in quantitative disciplines are encouraged. for brain initiative awards to date, see http://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/funding/fundedawards.htm . specific objectives of this foa the integrated program of research and training supported by this foa is intended for postdoctorates who are early in their postdoctoral training period in a given laboratory or research environment, rather than for advanced postdoctorates. support for early postdoctoral training will maximize the training potential of this fellowship award. given the interval when applications will be accepted (from 12 months prior to completing terminal degree requirements to 6 months after starting postdoctoral training), it is recognized that applicants are unlikely to have had the opportunity to generate preliminary data for the proposed project. accordingly, while inclusion of preliminary data in the application is permissible, it is not expected. the proposed research and training plan should focus on a research area and/or skill set that complements the applicant's existing research expertise and skills and that will broaden the applicant's knowledge and skills. for example, an applicant with existing skills in molecular/cellular neuroscience might propose a research training plan that emphasizes systems-level training. an applicant with existing neuroscience training might propose a research training plan that emphasizes neuroethics. an applicant trained in physics or statistics might propose a research training plan that emphasizes data-intensive/computational approaches to neuroscience. an applicant with research experience using non-human vertebrate animals might propose a research training plan using human subjects. the application should consist of a well-conceived scientific project, integrated with a comprehensive training plan, which is designed by a collaborative discussion between the candidate and sponsor. in addition to preparing the candidate to be a subject matter expert in the proposed research area and to acquire new technical skills, the research and training plans are expected to provide the candidate with a strong understanding of the principles of experimental design and quantitative analysis, and to incorporate quantitative approaches to answering the research question. further, the proposed research and training plan should enhance the individual’s potential to develop into a productive, independent researcher by providing strong mentorship, appropriate training and career development opportunities, and strong institutional support and commitment. the training plan should document the need for, and the anticipated value of, the proposed mentored training in relationship to the individual’s research career goals and the individual's prior research training. the training plan should be explicitly designed to facilitate the fellow’s transition to the next stage of his/her career. it is expected that the mentored training experience will provide: a strong foundation in quantitative reasoning, research design, methods, statistics and analytic techniques appropriate to the proposed research and sufficient to ensure that the applicant has the knowledge and skills to generate robust and reproducible data; experience conducting research using appropriate, state-of-the-art tools and methods relevant to the goals of the brain initiative, and an expert understanding of the tools and methods used; opportunities to present research findings at national meetings as the work progresses; opportunities to publish the research findings as first author; opportunities to interact with members of the scientific community at appropriate scientific meetings and workshops including brain initiative investigator meetings; and skills needed to transition to the next stage of the applicant s research career. to be considered responsive to this foa, the proposed research training plan must be relevant to the scientific goals of the brain 2025 report, as described in the required section on the relationship of the proposed research and training plan to one or more of the specific scientific goals stated in the brain 2025 report. applications that are not relevant to one or more goals of the brain 2025 report will not be reviewed. pre-submission consultation applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with nih scientific/research staff when planning an application. early contact provides an opportunity for nih scientific/research staff to provide guidance on program scope and appropriateness of the proposed research and training for potential funding in response to this foa. applicants should contact nih scientific/research staff as early as possible before the due date.

competing continuation award. the incurrence of pre-award costs in anticipation of a competing or non-competing award imposes no obligation on nih either to make the award or to increase the amount of the approved budget if an award is made for less than the amount anticipated and is inadequate to cover the pre-award costs incurred. nih expects the grantee to be fully aware that pre-award costs result in borrowing against future support and that such borrowing must not impair the grantee's ability to accomplish the project objectives in the approved time frame or in any way adversely affect the conduct of the project. see nih grants policy statement http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/nihgps_part6.htm . 6. other submission requirements the applicant must provide a detailed description of each core unit proposed as part of the center, with detailed budget and budget justification. budgetary items allowable for administrative core units include salaries and support for a limited number of administrative and clerical personnel; administrative support services, when not covered by institutional facilities and administrative (f & a) charges; travel to one center directors' meeting to discuss scientific advancements of the centers annually; and travel to one center directors' and administrators' meeting annually to confer with other nichd center directors. budgetary items allowable for other cores include salaries and support for core staff; supplies (including animals); scientific equipment; computer facilities and services; travel for technical or administrative staff for technical training or to maintain operation of the core unit; and consultant services . the applicant must name a scientist to be responsible for each core unit proposed. the description of each core unit proposed should include a rationale, indicating how the core will support the research effort in an efficient and cost-effective manner. cores should integrate with or buy in to existing institutional resources rather than duplicate them. core support to individual investigators should not overlap with support already available to them from other sources. the applicant institution and pertinent departments must show a strong commitment to the center's support. dedicated space and/or equipment, staff recruitment, investigators' salaries or other financial support for the proposed center exemplify such commitment. the facilities should require no more than modest alteration and/or renovation. nichd provides no funds for new construction. scientific personnel and institutional resources must be available to provide a strong research base in the specified fields. as a major goal, the mrddrc program promotes 1) interdisciplinary collaboration among centers investigators, 2) data/information sharing and integration, 3) synthesis of knowledge about mrdd, and 4) translational research that will lead to amelioration and prevention. each center application should present a specific plan for achieving this major goal. another goal of the mrddrc program is to attract scientists to mrdd research. where appropriate, the applicant may request up to five years' support for "new program development" for direct research support of one or more projects. this support should not exceed a total of $100,000 direct costs per year, or 10 percent of total direct costs, whichever is less. applicants may use such funds to attract new investigators to the center, to develop a new area or program of research, to facilitate the development of new research programs of newly trained investigators or investigators new to mrdd research, or to facilitate use of a core at one center by investigators affiliated with another center that lacks that kind of core. description of new program development projects should compare to r01 research grant applications in detail and development. each new program development project may provide support for no more than two years to any one investigator. a major goal of the nichd is to promote active collaboration among mrddrcs. to accomplish this goal, successful applicants will participate in the collaborative efforts of established centers' programs. in planning the program, applicants should consider potential collaborative studies and projects that they may propose for the mrddrcs network. the administrative core should budget for the maintenance of the mrddrc network web-portal and for the development of common protocols, databases, and communications and informatics technologies. plan for sharing research data the precise content of the data-sharing plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. applicants who are planning to share data may wish to describe briefly the expected schedule for data sharing, the format of the final dataset, the documentation to be provided, whether or not any analytic tools also will be provided, whether or not a data-sharing agreement will be required and, if so, a brief description of such an agreement (including the criteria for deciding who can receive the data and whether or not any conditions will be placed on their use), and the mode of data sharing (e.g., under their own auspices by mailing a disk or posting data on their institutional or personal website, through a data archive or enclave). investigators choosing to share under their own auspices may wish to enter into a data-sharing agreement. references to data sharing may also be appropriate in other sections of the application. applicants requesting more than $500,000 in direct costs in any year of the proposed research must include a plan for sharing research data in their application. the funding organization will be responsible for monitoring the data sharing policy ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing ). the reasonableness of the data sharing plan or the rationale for not sharing research data may be assessed by the reviewers. however, reviewers will not factor the proposed data sharing plan into the determination of scientific merit or the priority score. sharing research resources nih policy expects that grant recipients make unique research resources readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community after publication (nih grants policy statement http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/index.htm and http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/nihgps_part7.htm#_toc54600131 ). investigators responding to this funding opportunity should include a plan for sharing research resources addressing how unique research resources will be shared or explain why sharing is not possible. the adequacy of the resources sharing plan and any related data sharing plans will be considered by program staff of the funding organization when making recommendations about funding applications. the effectiveness of the resource sharing will be evaluated as part of the administrative review of each non-competing grant progress report (phs 2590, http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/2590/2590.htm ). see section vi.3. reporting . keeping with the goals of the mrddrc program enunciated in the guidelines and in other submission requirements, above, the applicants should highlight potentially unique core resources and how they plan to share them with other mrddrcs. section v. application review information 1. criteria only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. the following will be considered in making funding decisions: scientific merit of the proposed project as determined by peer review availability of funds relevance of program priorities cost-effectiveness of the core facilities cost of the center 2. review and selection process applications that are complete and responsive to the rfa will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate peer review group convened by nichd in accordance with the review criteria stated below. as part of the initial merit review, all applications will: undergo a selection process in which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific merit, generally the top half of applications under review, will be discussed and assigned a priority score. receive a written critique. receive a second level of review by national advisory child health and human development (nachhd) c ouncil. the goals of nih supported research are to advance our understanding of biological systems, to improve the control of disease, and to enhance health. in their written critiques, reviewers will be asked to comment on each of the following criteria in order to judge the likelihood that the proposed research will have a substantial impact on the pursuit of these goals. each of these criteria will be addressed and considered in assigning the overall score, weighting them as appropriate for each application. note that an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact and thus deserve a high priority score. for example, an investigator may propose to carry out important work that by its nature is not innovative but is essential to move a field forward. significance: does this study address an important problem? if the aims of the application are achieved, how will scientific knowledge or clinical practice be advanced? what will be the effect of these studies on the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? approach: are the conceptual or clinical framework, design, methods, and analyses adequately developed, well integrated, well reasoned, and appropriate to the aims of the project? does the applicant acknowledge potential problem areas and consider alternative tactics? innovation: is the project original and innovative? for example: does the project challenge existing paradigms or clinical practice; address an innovative hypothesis or critical barrier to progress in the field? does the project develop or employ novel concepts, approaches, methodologies, tools, or technologies for this area? investigators: are the investigators appropriately trained and well suited to carry out this work? is the work proposed appropriate to the experience level of the principal investigator and other researchers? does the investigative team bring complementary and integrated expertise to the project (if applicable)? environment: does the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? do the proposed studies benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, or subject populations, or employ useful collaborative arrangements? is there evidence of institutional support? in their considerations, the reviewers will also be guided by the following criteria: nichd will evaluate all applications responding to this rfa according to the review criteria for core units, new program development projects, and the overall center as outlined in the nichd p30 center core grant guidelines ( http://www.nichd.nih.gov/funding/mechanism/p30_guide.cfm ). review of competing continuation (renewal) applications (type 2) will evaluate the progress made by a center in the previous funding period in addition to the review criteria applied to new applications. the reviewers will evaluate productivity of investigators affiliated with a center by the number, impact and relevance to mrdd of the publications that acknowledge support by the center grant. a site visit is not a prerequisite for consideration of any application by an nichd review committee. site visits will not be conducted for applications responding to this rfa. the applicant should not rely on a site visit to supplement or improve an incompletely written application. a five-year total project period is required. core units may be recommended for a minimum of three years. this would not preclude requests for support of core units for less than three years. however, a minimum of three core units is required in each of the five years of the center grant. 2.a. additional review criteria: in addition to the above criteria, the following items will continue to be considered in the determination of scientific merit and the priority score: protection of human subjects from research risk: the involvement of human subjects and protections from research risk relating to their participation in the proposed research will be assessed (see the research plan, section e on human subjects in the phs form 398). inclusion of women, minorities and children in research: the adequacy of plans to include subjects from both genders, all racial and ethnic groups (and subgroups), and children as appropriate for the scientific goals of the research will be assessed. plans for the recruitment and retention of subjects will also be evaluated (see the research plan, section e on human subjects in the phs form 398). care and use of vertebrate animals in research: if vertebrate animals are to be used in the project, the five items described under section f of the phs form 398 research grant application instructions will be assessed. biohazards: if materials or procedures are proposed that are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, determine if the proposed protection is adequate. 2.b. additional review considerations budget: the reasonableness of the proposed budget and the requested period of support in relation to the proposed research. the priority score should not be affected by the evaluation of the budget. 2.c. sharing research data data sharing plan: the reasonableness of the data sharing plan or the rationale for not sharing research data may be assessed by the reviewers. however, reviewers will not factor the proposed data sharing plan into the determination of scientific merit or the priority score. the funding organization will be responsible for monitoring the data sharing policy. http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing . 2.d. sharing research resources nih policy expects that grant recipients make unique research resources readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community after publication (see the nih grants policy statement http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/part_ii_5.htm#availofrr and http://www.ott.nih.gov/policy/rt_guide_final.html ). investigators responding to this funding opportunity should include a sharing research resources plan addressing how unique research resources will be shared or explain why sharing is not possible. the reviewers will be asked to assess the adequacy of the plan. 3. anticipated announcement and award dates not applicable section vi. award administration information 1. award notices after the peer review of the application is completed, the pd/pi will be able to access his or her summary statement (written critique) via the era commons . if the application is under consideration for funding, nih will request "just-in-time" information from the applicant. for details, applicants may refer to the nih grants policy statement part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart a: general ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/nihgps_part4.htm ). a formal notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document. once all administrative and programmatic issues have been resolved, the noa will be generated via email notification from the awarding component to the grantee business official (designated in item 12 on the application face page). if a grantee is not email enabled, a hard copy of the noa will be mailed to the business official. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. see also section iv.5. funding restrictions . 2. administrative and national policy requirements all nih grant and cooperative agreement awards include the nih grants policy statement as part of the noa. for these terms of award, see the nih grants policy statement part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart a: general ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/nihgps_part4.htm ) and part ii terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart b: terms and conditions for specific types of grants, grantees, and activities ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/nihgps_part9.htm ). 3. reporting awardees will be required to submit the phs non-competing grant progress report, form 2590 annually ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/2590/2590.htm ) and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement. the non-competing grant progress reports must explicitly describe the progress in achieving the goals of the mrddrc program that are articulated in this document and should follow the guidelines presented in the "nichd p30 center core grant

should request full needs for tuition and fees. the nih ic will apply the appropriate formula by offsetting the combined costs of requested tuition and fees at the rate in place at the time of the award. for postdoctoral trainees, an amount equal to 60% of the level requested by the applicant institution, up to $4,500 per year, will be provided. if the program supports postdoctoral individuals in formal degree-granting training, the amount provided per trainee enrolled in a degree-granting program will be 60% of the level requested up to $16,000 per year. costs associated with this category are allowable only if they are required as part of the approved research training program and are applied consistently to all persons in a similar research training status at the institution regardless of the source of support. tuition at the postdoctoral level is limited to that required for specific courses in support of the approved training program which should be identified in the application. a full description of the nih tuition policy, see not-od-06-093 . trainee travel: trainee travel to attend scientific meetings and workshops that the institution determines to be necessary for the individual s research training experience is an allowable trainee expense. funds may not be expended to cover the costs of travel between the trainee’s place of residence and the training institution, except that the grantee organization may authorize a one-way travel allowance in an individual case of extreme hardship. amounts for trainee travel are not uniform throughout the nih. trainees must be appointed to this training program at the time of actual travel for this to be an allowable cost. applicants are strongly urged to contact appropriate ic scientific staff listed under section vi i for guidance prior to preparing the application. additionally, support for travel to a research training experience away from the institution may be permitted. research training experiences away from the parent organization must be justified considering the type of opportunities available for training, and how the opportunities differ from and complement those offered at the parent institution, and the relationship of the proposed training experience to the trainee’s career stage and goals. this type of travel and research training requires prior approval from the nih awarding component, and, if not known at the time of application, may be submitted at any time during the award period. training related expenses, including health insurance (tre): the applicant institution may request the nih standard nrsa training related expenses (fy 2010: $7,850 annually for each postdoctoral trainee) to help defray other research training expenses, such as health insurance (self-only or family, as applicable), staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, research supplies, and faculty/staff travel directly related to the research training program. health insurance is an allowable expense that may be charged to the training related expenses budget category but only to the extent that the same health insurance fees are charged to non-federally-supported students and postdoctoral individuals (see not-od-06-093 for additional information). funds are provided as a lump sum on the basis of the predetermined amount per predoctoral and postdoctoral trainee approved for support. under exceptional circumstances, which can include accommodating the disabilities of a trainee, it is possible to request training related expenses above the standard level. requests for additional costs must be explained in detail and justified in the application. consultation with nih program staff in advance of such requests is strongly advised (see section vi i ). facilities and administrative (f&a) allowance: grantees, other than state, local, or indian tribal governments, will receive f&a costs at 8 percent of modified total direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, health insurance (when still awarded in the tuition and fees category), consortiums in excess of $25,000, and expenditures for equipment) rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement. state, local, and indian tribal government agencies are eligible for full f&a cost reimbursement. for this policy, state universities or hospitals are not considered governmental agencies. stipend supplementation, compensation, and other income: the grantee institution is allowed to provide funds to an individual in addition to the stipends paid by the nih. such additional amounts either may be in the form of augmented stipends (supplementation) or in the form of compensation, such as salary or tuition remission for services such as teaching or serving as a laboratory assistant, provided the conditions described below are met. under no circumstances may the conditions of stipend supplementation or the services provided for compensation interfere with, detract from, or prolong the trainee's approved nrsa training program. supplementation: grantees may supplement stipends from non-federal funds provided the supplementation is without obligation to the trainee. an organization can determine what amount of stipend supplementation, if any, will be provided according to its own formally established policies governing stipend support. these policies must be consistently applied to all individuals in a similar training status regardless of the source of funds. federal funds may not be used for stipend supplementation unless specifically authorized under the terms of the program from which funds are derived. an individual may use federal educational loan funds or va benefits when permitted by those programs. under no circumstances may phs funds be used for supplementation. compensation: funds characterized as compensation may be paid to trainees only when there is an employer-employee relationship, the payments are for services rendered, and the situation otherwise meets all of the conditions and policies in the nih grants policy statement. additionally, compensation must be in accordance with organizational policies consistently applied to both federally and non-federally supported activities and must be supported by acceptable accounting records that reflect the employer-employee relationship. an institution may provide additional funds to a trainee in the form of compensation (as salary and/or tuition remission) for services performed outside of the responsibilities of the full-time nrsa-supported training such as teaching or serving as a research assistant. a trainee may receive compensation for services as a research assistant or in some other position on a federal research grant, including a dhhs research grant. however, compensated services should occur on a limited, part-time basis apart from the normal full-time research training activities. in addition, compensation may not be paid from a research grant that supports the same research that is part of the trainee’s planned training experience as approved in the institutional training grant application. the training pd/pi must approve all instances of employment on research grants to verify that the circumstances will not detract from or prolong the approved training program. a full description of the nih policy regarding nrsa supplementation and compensation can be found in the nih grants policy statement at: nih grants policy statement - part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards . educational loans or g.i. bill: an individual may make use of federal educational loan funds and assistance under the veterans readjustment benefits act (g.i. bill). such funds are not considered supplementation or compensation.

RFA-GM-11-002,ii. computational, mathematical, and statistical model research one of midas’s central goals is to develop and improve mathematical, computational, and statistical methods for studying infectious diseases and to develop tools that will assist public health decision makers. applicants should take account of the needs of the public health and research communities in designing and producing models. the following areas should be addressed: conceptual development of models. underlying theories, including assumptions and approaches, strengths and weaknesses, should be clearly explained. applicants should take into account the needs of the communities (i.e., public health, policy and decision making) that will be end users of the products of the research. the projects should also address plans for the dissemination of useful products of the research, including approaches, technologies and tools, to the relevant research and user communities. other potential areas of research include (1) tools for archiving, managing, integrating querying, retrieving, and visualizing model results; (2) analytical and statistical tools for interpreting and using large data sets or model results; and/or (3) platform-independent translational tools for data exchange, interoperability, and exchange of models, tools, and results. computational, mathematical, and statistical research proposed should be future-oriented, fill an area of need or projected need, and exceed the current state of the art. model verification and validation. the applicant must propose steps to verify that methods employed behave as expected, that is, that the software or equations have been reviewed, tested, and documented. validation is an important goal but may or may not be possible, depending on the nature of the model. applicants should explain how they will approach validation of software. successful applicants will be expected to confer with other members of the network to seek consensus on these topics. dissemination. one product of midas research groups may be software tools that are of value to the public health, research, and policy and decision making communities. software tools developed with midas support will be available, where feasible, to researchers, educators, the public health community, and government organizations. software tools should be designed and developed in collaboration with the user community. additional information: organizational structure of midas the midas network has five components: a steering committee, an executive committee, centers of excellence, an information technology resource, and research groups. the steering committee is the main oversight body for midas and makes recommendations to nigms regarding scientific direction, resources, concerns and issues, evaluation, and similar topics. the committee includes representation from user groups such as public health officials, representatives of the research community, and nih scientist administrators with relevant expertise. outside expertise ensures sufficient breadth and balance on the committee. nih scientist administrators will not comprise more than 40% of the voting members of the steering committee. the executive committee coordinates and manages the midas network, including coordination of multi-group projects. it is made up of the principal investigators of grants funded through the midas program and will meet monthly by videoconference or conference call. the research groups are teams of multidisciplinary, collaborating scientists from one or more institutions who have expertise in fields relevant to midas. the research groups will offer to the midas network complementary combinations of two or more competencies in: computational and mathematical methods, the biology of infectious disease systems, social networks and behavior, population dynamics, genetic variation and evolution, and environmental modeling. when there are urgent national needs each midas research group must make a commitment to focus midas research on specific tasks of national importance. also, research groups will participate fully in collaborative network research. the centers of excellence provide national and international leadership in four major thematic areas infectious disease research; computational, statistical, and mathematical research; education and outreach; and public health policy. the information technology resource supports and extends the work of the midas centers of excellence and research groups by (1) collecting, managing, and generating data relevant to the systems the research projects and centers are studying; (2) supporting software development and testing when needed by the midas consortium; (3) providing support for dissemination of information and for outreach, including design and maintenance of a midas web site; and (4) providing logistical support for midas activities. the information technology resource acts in partnership with the midas centers of excellence and research groups. partnerships are expected to be highly interactive and collaborative in defining needs, planning and carrying out projects, and disseminating results and products. where appropriate to address urgent national needs, funded project s will be expected to focus midas research on specific tasks of national importance . in addition, projects will participate fully in collaborative network research as developed by the midas executive committee . the midas network requires a commitment to cooperative interactions that must be addressed in the application. specific domains of interaction can be found in section iv.6. projects funded through midas use existing sequence, genetic, epidemiological, clinical, climate, etc., information to conduct research. they will not generate primary data using midas funding, with the exception of synthesized data. see section
