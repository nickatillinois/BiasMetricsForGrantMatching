(t32) award mechanism(s). the project director/principal investigator (pd/pi) will be solely responsible for planning, directing, and executing the proposed project. this foa uses just-in-time information concepts. it also uses non-modular budget formats described in the phs 398 application instructions (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.html ). a detailed categorical budget for the \"initial budget period\" and the \"entire proposed period of support\" is to be submitted with the application, following the instructions for preparing an nrsa institutional research training (t32) grant application. applicants to this rfa are only required to submit the first five training data tables requested of applicants to the ruth l. kirschstein nrsa institutional research training ( t32) grant mechanism. if applicable, the qualifications of recent and/or current pre-doctoral applicant trainees may either be presented in tables 8a and/or 9a respectively or discussed in narrative form. 2. funds available nibib has set aside $3- 4m to fund between 10-12 interdisciplinary research training programs under this initiative. applicants may not request more than $500,000 in direct costs or more than 10 slots for any grant year. because the nature and scope of the proposed interdisciplinary research training programs will vary from application to application, it is anticipated that the size of each award will also vary. the number of awards and the actual amount awarded are therefore contingent upon the receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications and will depend upon the number, quality, and costs of the applications received. although the financial plans of the ic(s) provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds and the receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. facilities and administrative costs requested by consortium participants are not included in the direct cost limitation, see not-od-05-004 . nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made in response to this foa. allowable costs: a. stipends: stipends are provided as a subsistence allowance for trainees to help defray living expenses during the research training experience and are based on a 12-month appointment period. this stipend is not provided as a condition of employment with either the federal government or the grantee institution nor is it to be considered a payment for services performed. stipends will be based on the annual pre-doctoral nrsa stipend level at the time of award. the annual stipend level for a pre-doctoral trainee for fiscal year (fy) 2008 is $20,772. stipends may be adjusted only at the time of appointment or reappointment and may not be changed in the middle of an appointment period. for appointments of less than a full year, the stipend will be based on a monthly or daily pro-ration of the annual amount. no departure from the established stipend schedule may be negotiated by the institution with the trainee (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-07-057.html for specific information). b. tuition and fees: the nih will offset the combined costs of tuition and fees at the rate in place at the time of the award. the rate currently provides an amount per predoctoral trainee equal to 60% of the level requested by the applicant institution, up to $16,000 per year. costs associated with this category are allowable only if they are required for specific courses as part of the approved research training program and are applied consistently to all persons in a similar research training status at the institution regardless of the source of support. a full description of the nih tuition policy, see: http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-06-093.html . c. trainee travel: trainee travel to attend scientific meetings and workshops that the institution determines to be necessary for the individual’s research training experience is an allowable trainee expense. in addition, the nibib requires that applicants include funds to allow training program director(s) (pds) and two to four trainees to attend the biennial nibib training grantee meeting, held in even-numbered years in the washington dc/bethesda, md area. note that funds for pds should be included under training related expenses (tre) while funds for trainees to attend the meeting should be requested as trainee travel. funds may not be expended to cover the costs of travel between the trainee s place of residence and the training institution, except that the grantee organization may authorize a one-way travel allowance in an individual case of extreme hardship. additionally, support for travel to a research training experience away from the institution may be permitted. research training experiences away from the parent organization must be justified considering the type of opportunities available for training, the manner in which these opportunities differ from, and complement those, offered at the parent institution, and the relationship of the proposed training experience to the trainee’s career stage and goals. this type of travel and research training requires prior approval from the nibib. letters requesting such training may be submitted to the nibib at any time during the award period. d. training-related expenses: the applicant institution may request the nih standard nrsa training-related expenses ($4,200 annually for each predoctoral trainee in fy 2008) to help defray other research training expenses, such as health insurance, staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, research supplies, and travel expenses for the training faculty directly related to the research training program (see http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-06-093.html for additional information). funds are provided as a lump sum on the basis of the predetermined amount per predoctoral trainee approved for support. under exceptional circumstances, which can include accommodating the disabilities of a trainee, it is possible to request training-related expenses above the standard level. requests for additional costs must be explained in detail and justified in the application. consultation with nibib staff in advance of such requests is strongly advised. e. facilities and administrative allowance: a facilities and administrative allowance (indirect cost allowance) based on 8% of total modified direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, health insurance, and equipment) may be requested. f. stipend supplementation, compensation, and other income: stipend supplementation: the grantee institution is allowed to provide funds to an individual in addition to the stipends paid in the form of stipend supplementation or in the form of compensation. under no circumstances may the conditions of stipend supplementation or the services provided for compensation interfere with, detract from, or prolong the trainee's approved nrsa training program. grantees may supplement stipends from non-federal funds provided the supplementation is without obligation to the trainee. an organization can determine what amount of stipend supplementation, if any, will be provided according to its own formally established policies governing stipend support. these policies must be consistently applied to all individuals in a similar training status regardless of the source of funds. federal funds may not be used for stipend supplementation unless specifically authorized under the terms of the program from which funds are derived. an individual may use federal educational loan funds or va benefits when permitted by those programs. under no circumstances may dhhs funds be used for supplementation. compensation: funds characterized as compensation may be paid to trainees only when there is an employer-employee relationship, the payments are for services rendered, and the situation otherwise meets all of the conditions and policies in the nih grants policy statement. additionally, compensation must be in accordance with organizational policies consistently applied to both federally and non-federally supported activities and must be supported by acceptable accounting records that reflect the employer-employee relationship. an institution may provide additional funds to a trainee in the form of compensation (as salary and/or tuition remission) for services performed outside of the responsibilities of the full-time nrsa-supported training such as teaching or serving as a research assistant. a trainee may receive compensation for services as a research assistant or in some other position on a federal research grant, including a dhhs research grant. however, compensated services should occur on a limited, part-time basis apart from the normal full-time research training activities. in addition, compensation may not be paid from a research grant that supports the same research that is part of the trainee’s planned training experience as approved in the institutional training grant application. pds must approve all instances of employment on research grants to verify that the circumstances will not detract from or prolong the approved training program. a full description of the nih policy regarding nrsa supplementation and compensation can be found in the nih grants policy statement at http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/nihgps_part11.htm . educational loans or g.i. bill : an individual may make use of federal educational loan funds and assistance under the veterans readjustment benefits act (g.i. bill). such funds are not considered supplementation or compensation.
